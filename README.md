__Game objective__
Use augmented reality to view a human heart and scan its major parts to learn more about how they function. This knowledge can be used to create a short presentation.
__Game rules__
● Using the School ebook, scan the Medica Interactive QR code and open the experience.

● Tap the heart to bring it to life.

● Tap each part of the heart to unlock more information.

● If the player is not actively exploring the heart, it will eventually stop beating and fall to the ground.

__Heart gameplay__
The heart will initially be gray and lifeless. Once the user taps the heart, it will start beating and assume a healthy color.

The heart will be divided into its four principal parts. Everytime the user taps one of these parts, informational will appear on screen. The four heart sections are:
● Right Atrium
● Right Ventricle
● Left Atrium
● Left Ventricle
If the heart is left unattended and stops beating, it must be tapped to be brought back to life again.

__User Interface (UI)__
The UI will consist of four buttons, one pointing to each section of the Heart. These buttons will be provided as a whole texture atlas, that will be overlaid on top of the Heart’s model in 3D space.
Each of these buttons will open an information panel when clicked and display the content .
